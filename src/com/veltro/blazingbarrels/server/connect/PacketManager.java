/**
 * The PacketManager is where all of the server's logic - which is based on the packets it receives - occurs. The
 * server's operation is split into 2-part "cycles", which occur 30 times per second.<p>
 * 
 * In the first phase of a cycle, the PacketManager iterates through the packets that have accumulated in the
 * {@link ReceiverThread}'s queue since the last cycle, casting them to {@link BBPacket} subclasses and updating the
 * game (moving players, handling weapon firing and collisions, etc.) based on their data.<p>
 * 
 * The second phase of each cycle is oriented towards updating the BlazingBarrels clients connected to the server. The
 * PacketManager determines which changes to the game should be sent to which clients and then generates the
 * appropriate BBPacket subclasses and adds them to the {@link SenderThread}'s outbound packet queue.
