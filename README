#BBServer v0.3.9

BBServer instances enable multiple BlazingBarrels clients to connect and
interact in real time.

##Authorization

When attempting to connect to a BBServer instance for multiplayer gameplay,
users are prompted to enter both the address and password of a server. If the
server running at the provided address has a password that matches the supplied
one, then the client is permitted to connect and is given a window in which to
send a packet confirming joining before being automatically deauthorized due to
communication timeout.

##Data Transfer

BBServer instances communicate with BlazingBarrels clients using a packet-based
UDP connection. As such, the BBServer maintains three packet transfer threads:
* ReceiverThread - collects and unpacks incoming packets
* SenderThread - packs and sends packets to specific clients or broadcasts them
to every connected player
